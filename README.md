## usage of the script run_analysis.R
=====================================

The script accepts two parameters:

1. the name of the directory, that contains all the data: ie the directory contains the two directories train and test. Default is the current directory.

2. the file name of the final file. Default is "final.csv" 

The call of the script is simply run_analysis() when the defaults fit.
